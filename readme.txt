The Plugin that PAYS YOU!

The TCGplayer.com Plug-in provides an additional revenue source for your website along with an instantaneous way for you to turn all Magic: the Gathering card names within your blog posts into card information links with Hi-Mid-Low pricing! Just type up your entire post and then click the "Card Parse Article" button. All Magic: the Gathering card names are instantly turned into links that have a hover effect showing the card image and its current Hi-Mid-Low price from over 30 of the internets cheapest vendors!

If that wasn't useful enough TCGplayer will also provide you a commission on all sales sent through the card links.

= What is the minimum PHP version? =

This plugin requires PHP 5.0.0 or later.

This depends a lot on your server and the total length of the text you are parsing but is usually a few seconds.
Once parsing is finished all card names will be transformed into links.
Please refrain from changing the text while it is being parsed for card names.
